abstract={We focus on sparse modelling of high-dimensional covariance matrices using Bayesian latent factor models. We propose a multiplicative gamma process shrinkage prior on the factor loadings which allows introduction of infinitely many factors, with the loadings increasingly shrunk towards zero as the column index increases. We use our prior on a parameter-expanded loading matrix to avoid the order dependence typical in factor analysis models and develop an efficient Gibbs sampler that scales well as data dimensionality increases. The gain in efficiency is achieved by the joint conjugacy property of the proposed prior, which allows block updating of the loadings matrix. We propose an adaptive Gibbs sampler for automatically truncating the infinite loading matrix through selection of the number of important factors. Theoretical results are provided on the support of the prior and truncation approximation bounds. A fast algorithm is proposed to produce approximate Bayes estimates. Latent factor regression methods are developed for prediction and variable selection in applications with high-dimensional correlated predictors. Operating characteristics are assessed through simulation studies, and the approach is applied to predict survival times from gene expression data.},

abstract = {A statistical model or a learning machine is called regular if the map taking a parameter
to a probability distribution is one-to-one and if its Fisher information matrix is
always positive definite. If otherwise, it is called singular. In regular statistical
models, the Bayes free energy, which is defined by the minus logarithm of Bayes marginal
likelihood, can be asymptotically approximated by the Schwarz Bayes information criterion
(BIC), whereas in singular models such approximation does not hold.Recently, it was
proved that the Bayes free energy of a singular model is asymptotically given by a
generalized formula using a birational invariant, the real log canonical threshold
(RLCT), instead of half the number of parameters in BIC. Theoretical values of RLCTs
in several statistical models are now being discovered based on algebraic geometrical
methodology. However, it has been difficult to estimate the Bayes free energy using
only training samples, because an RLCT depends on an unknown true distribution.In
the present paper, we define a widely applicable {B}ayesian information criterion (WBIC)
by the average log likelihood function over the posterior distribution with the inverse
temperature 1/log n, where n is the number of training samples. We mathematically
prove that WBIC has the same asymptotic expansion as the Bayes free energy, even if
a statistical model is singular for or unrealizable by a statistical model. Since
WBIC can be numerically calculated without any information about a true distribution,
it is a generalized version of BIC onto singular statistical models.},

By using posterior sampling algorithms, one can quantify uncertainty without relying on asymptotic approximations. However, sharply constrained priors are not necessary in some settings and tend to limit modelling scope to a narrow set of distributions that are tractable computationally. We propose to replace the sharp indicator function of the constraint with an exponential kernel, thereby creating a close-to-constrained neighbourhood within the Euclidean space in which the constrained subspace is embedded. This kernel decays with distance from the constrained space at a rate depending on a relaxation hyperparameter. By avoiding the sharp constraint, we enable use of off-the-shelf posterior sampling algorithms, such as Hamiltonian {M}onte {C}arlo, facilitating automatic computation in a broad range of models. We study the constrained and relaxed distributions under multiple settings and theoretically quantify their differences. Application of the method is illustrated through several novel modelling examples.}",

abstract = {Summary In studies involving functional data, it is commonly of interest to model the impact of predictors on the distribution of the curves, allowing flexible effects on not only the mean curve but also the distribution about the mean. Characterizing the curve for each subject as a linear combination of a high-dimensional set of potential basis functions, we place a sparse latent factor regression model on the basis coefficients. We induce basis selection by choosing a shrinkage prior that allows many of the loadings to be close to zero. The number of latent factors is treated as unknown through a highly-efficient, adaptive-blocked Gibbs sampler. Predictors are included on the latent variables level, while allowing different predictors to impact different latent factors. This model induces a framework for functional response regression in which the distribution of the curves is allowed to change flexibly with predictors. The performance is assessed through simulation studies and the methods are applied to data on blood pressure trajectories during pregnancy.},

The method is applied to the problem of estimating recent changes in effective population size from temporally spaced gene frequency data. The method gives the posterior distribution of effective population size at the time of the oldest sample and at the time of the most recent sample, assuming a model of exponential growth or decline during the interval. The effect of changes in number of alleles, number of loci, and sample size on the accuracy of the method is described using test simulations, and it is concluded that these have an approximately equivalent effect. The method is used on three example data sets and problems in interpreting the posterior densities are highlighted and discussed.},

The feasibility of a sensor fusion algorithm as a calibrating tool for the multi-sensor device is discussed. A Conventional air pollution monitoring station is used to provide reference data. Results are assessed by means of prediction error characterization throughout a 13 months long interval and discussed. Relationship between training length and performances are also investigated. A neural calibration obtained using a small number of measurement days revealed to be capable to limit the absolute prediction error for more than 6th month, after which seasonal influences on prediction capabilities at low-concentrations suggested the need for a further calibration.}

journal={Journal of the Royal Statistical Society. Series B (Statistical Methodology)},
volume={82},

pages={1249-1271},
abstract={Summary
Current tools for multivariate density estimation struggle when the density is concentrated near a non‐linear subspace or manifold. Most approaches require the choice of a kernel, with the multivariate Gaussian kernel by far the most commonly used. Although heavy‐tailed and skewed extensions have been proposed, such kernels cannot capture curvature in the support of the data. This leads to poor performance unless the sample size is very large relative to the dimension of the data.  The paper proposes a novel generalization of the Gaussian distribution, which includes an additional curvature parameter.  We refer to the proposed class as Fisher–Gaussian kernels, since they arise by sampling from a von Mises–Fisher density on the sphere and adding Gaussian noise. The Fisher–Gaussian density has an analytic form and is amenable to straightforward implementation within Bayesian mixture models by using Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling.  We provide theory on large support and illustrate gains relative to competitors in simulated and real data applications.},

SAM maintains the same hierarchical structure as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), but models documents as points on a high-dimensional spherical manifold, allowing a natural likelihood parameterization in terms of cosine distance. Furthermore, SAM can model word absence/presence at the document level, and unlike previous models can assign explicit negative weight to topic terms. Performance is evaluated empirically, both through human ratings of topic quality and through diverse classification tasks from natural language processing and computer vision. In these experiments, SAM consistently outperforms existing models.}, booktitle = {Proceedings of the 27th International Conference on International Conference on Machine Learning}, pages = {903–910}, numpages = {8}}

Roy. Statist. Soc. Ser. B, 65, 367–389, 2003), and derives formulae for it’s characteristics; mean and covariance. The extended GSE family is particularly relevant whenever the need arises to model data by skewed distributions, as is the case in actuarial science, risk management and other branches of science. The paper also generalizes the skew-normal distribution in the sense of Azzalini and Dalla Valle (Biometrika, 83, 715–726, 1996). Furthermore, for estimation purposes, the maximum likelihood equations are derived. Finally, a numerical examples is provided which demonstrates that the extended GSE distribution offers a better fit in comparison to the GSE distribution.},

This has been considered mainly for central symmetry of a Euclidean space in the origin. This paper enlarges the concept of modulation to the general setting of symmetry under the action of a compact topological group on the sample space. The main structural result relates the density of an arbitrary distribution to the density of the corresponding symmetrised distribution. Some general methods for constructing modulating functions are considered. The effect that transformations of the sample space have on symmetry of distributions is investigated. The results are illustrated by general examples, many of them in the setting of directional statistics."

An application to time series is discussed. It is shown that the mean, covariance, and correlation structure of the sample autocovariance function for a particular class of time series depend on a measure of multivariate kurtosis, but not on a shape parameter. Unlike the multivariate normal distribution and the elliptical distributions with Muirhead kurtosis parameter 0, the covariance and the correlation of the sample autocovariance function for a particular class of time series with underlying scale mixtures of normal distribution are not always negative. We show this using an example of the generalized t distribution. As a by-product, we derived Muirhead kurtosis for some scale mixtures of normal distribution."

Its normalising constant can be expressed as an elementary function multiplied by the density, evaluated at 1, of a linear combination of independent noncentral $\chi _{1}^{2}$ random variables. Hence we may approximate the normalising constant by applying a saddlepoint approximation to this density. Three such approximations, implementation of each of which is straightforward, are investigated: the first-order saddlepoint density approximation, the second-order saddlepoint density approximation and a variant of the second-order approximation which has proved slightly more accurate than the other two. The numerical and theoretical results we present show that this approach provides highly accurate approximations in a broad spectrum of cases.},

abstract = {Summary. A fairly general procedure is studied to perturb a multivariate density satisfying a weak form of multivariate symmetry, and to generate a whole set of non-symmetric densities. The approach is sufficiently general to encompass some recent proposals in the literature, variously related to the skew normal distribution. The special case of skew elliptical densities is examined in detail, establishing connections with existing similar work. The final part of the paper specializes further to a form of multivariate skew t-density. Likelihood inference for this distribution is examined, and it is illustrated with numerical examples.},

abstract={This paper introduces generalized skew-elliptical distributions (GSE), which include the multivariate skew-normal, skew-t, skew-Cauchy, and skew-elliptical distributions as special cases. GSE are weighted elliptical distributions but the distribution of any even function in GSE random vectors does not depend on the weight function. In particular, this holds for quadratic forms in GSE random vectors. This property is beneficial for inference from non-random samples. We illustrate the latter point on a data set of Australian athletes.},

We also obtain the moment generating functions and study some distributional properties. Several examples are provided."

In one special case it is shown how a best subset of the independent variates of any size can readily be found for data under analysis.},
