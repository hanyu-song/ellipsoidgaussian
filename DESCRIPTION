Title: Fit an Ellipsoid-Gaussian Model
Version: 1.0.0
Author: Hanyu Song
Maintainer: Hanyu Song <songhanyu1211@gmail.com>
Description: Provides Bayesian estimation of the
    ellipsoid-Gaussian model introduced by Song and Dunson (2022).  The
    ellipsoid-Gaussian distribution can be used for modeling data distributed
    around a hyper-ellipsoid. It is induced when we use a Gaussian linear
    factor model with latent variables following a von Mises-Fisher
    distribution and have the latent variables integrated out. We also provide options
    for generating samples from the posterior predictive distribution,
    code for post-processing results. Some plotting functions are also included.
