## Description

The package provides Bayesian estimation of the ellipsoid-Gaussian model
introduced by Song and Dunson (2022). The model was inspired by the need
for new models for characterizing dependence in multivariate data. The
multivariate Gaussian distribution is routinely used, but cannot
characterize nonlinear relationships in the data. Most non-linear
extensions tend to be highly complex; for example, involving estimation
of a non-linear regression model in latent variables. The relatively
simple class of ellipsoid-Gaussian multivariate distributions, which are
derived by using a Gaussian linear factor model involving latent
variables having a von Mises-Fisher distribution on a unit hyper-sphere,
can be used for modeling data distributed around a hyper-ellipsoid. In
addition to fitting the model, the package also provides options for
post-processing the posterior samples and generating samples from the
posterior predictive distribution. Plotting functions are also included.

## Installation

You can install the development version of ellipsoidgaussian from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("hanyu-song/ellipsoidgaussian")
```

The package uses Cayley transform ellipsoid fitting (Melikechi and
Dunson 2023) for initial values of the parameters in the model, which
depends on [the Python module ctef](https://github.com/omelikechi/ctef).
The module is NOT automatically installed when the package is installed.
To install the module, follow the instruction on the [GitHub
page](https://github.com/omelikechi/ctef). Make sure the module is
installed in the path as the Python used in R; run

``` r
reticulate::py_config()
```

to see the path to Python. Unfortunately, there is an issue with the 
Python module, specifically empty __init__.py file and I've contacted the 
author for an udpate.

## Example

``` r
library(ellipsoidgaussian)
```

Here we demonstrate the usage of the package using the included horse
mussels data; more details can be found in the vignette.

Use the help function to learn about the data set:

``` r
help(mussels)
```

To visualize the data, do

``` r
pairsPlot_onedata(scale(mussels))
#> Registered S3 method overwritten by 'GGally':
#>   method from   
#>   +.gg   ggplot2
```

To fit an ellipsoid-Gaussian model, run

``` r
samples <- ellipsoid_gaussian(dat = mussels,
                                k = 2, 
                                scale_col = TRUE, 
                                updateCenter = TRUE, 
                                niter = 5000)
#> Center is initialized as  0.144 -0.022 0.176 0.081 1.028

Then we can generate posterior predictive samples using

``` r
  ppd <- gen_posterior_predictive(n = 200, samples = samples, burnin = 2500)
```

We can also visualize the posterior predictive samples in juxatoposition
with the original data using

``` r
  pairsPlot(scale(mussels), ppd)
```

Factor loadings are unidentifiable in a factor model. To post process
the samples, run

``` r
  aligned <- postprocess(scale(mussels), samples, burnin = 2500)

After post-processing the samples, visualize the posterior mean of the
factor loadings for interpretation.

``` r
  plot_factor_loadings(lambda_samples = aligned$lambda, 
                       variable_names = names(mussels),
                       row_idx = 1:4) 
```

This suggests that the shell size, as measured by an average of height,
length and width, is a good indicator of the muscle mass.
